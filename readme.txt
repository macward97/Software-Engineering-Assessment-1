The compiled exe of the .py file is MovieInformationClient.exe in the ROOT folder, do not use the one inside the DIST Folder. Use that if you don't need or have Python or any dependencies. 

The program requires downloading the entire project folder. Downloading the .exe solely will cause problems due to the text files required for operation in the ROOT folder.
